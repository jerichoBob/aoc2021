# aoc2021
This code in this repo is a travesty -- good thing I am just doing this for my own enjoyment (and your humor :).

*(since AOC has many possible interpretations, please allow me to disabiguate):* The code found in this repo is my implementation for the **2021 Advent of Code**.

*Also, since [Advent of Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code) didn't show up on the [AOC Wikipedia disambiguation page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOC), I added it -- my first Wiki submission :))*
